	<h1>Pergolas Central Coast Specialist</h1>
	<p>
	Pergolas Central Coast is the most trusted Pergola company on the Central Coast. We use only quality materials and our professional team of contractors, carpenters, and designers ensure that your pergola will be up to code with all necessary permits before it’s installed on-site. Pergolas are a great investment because they add value to any home or property while providing shade from summer heat and shelter during winter storms for years to come. Pergolas also help reduce air conditioning bills by shading your home from direct sunlight which causes an average reduction in energy costs of 10%+ annually!
